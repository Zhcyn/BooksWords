# BooksWords
This app lets you know how many times a word is contained in a book in the book library section or in a book downloaded from the web. 
I created an offline book library containing four books from (https://www.gutenberg.org/) and I opened them using the utf8 encoding, setting the isoLatin1 encoding as fallback.
To calculate the number of occurrences of a word, I first transformed the text of the book into a String array, then I grouped these words into a [String: Int] dictionary, sorting it by the number of occurrences and alphabetically by the word, then I improved this algorithm using [Swift's lazy collections] achieving a 10% performance increase.
The disadvantage of this algorithm consists in cyclically sequentially every word of the book, but the results are good (~0.069 seconds for an array of 2500 elements). Obviously, in order not to have to wait for this fraction of time while opening a book, the algorithm was executed on a background queue, without affecting the UI performance.
I also implemented another algorithm to calculate the number of occurrences of a word, but it turned out to be about 4 times worse than the original one. This algorithm consists in alphabetically ordering the array containing the words of the book and cycling it, checking each time whether the current word corresponds to the previous one.
